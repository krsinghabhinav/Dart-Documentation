Swapping in programming is the act of exchanging the values of two variables. This allows for the rearrangement of data within a program's memory space, which can facilitate algorithms and operations

//Swapping a number........
void main() {
  int a = 29;
  int b = 40;
  int temp;
  print("Swapping a number=====");
  temp = a;
  a = b;
  b = temp;
  print("a===== $a");
  print("b=====$b");
}
